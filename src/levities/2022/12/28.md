Stan gratuliert sich selbst. (Mit Medium ChatGPT).

Hi there, True Believers! It's your old pal, Stan "The Man" Lee, here to say a big thank you for all the love and support on my hundredth birthday!

I can't believe it's been a century since I first came into this world, but let me tell you, it's been one wild and wonderful ride. I've had the privilege of creating some of the most iconic characters in the history of comics, and seeing them come to life on the big screen has been a dream come true.

From Spider-Man to the X-Men, the Avengers to the Fantastic Four, I've had a hand in shaping the Marvel Universe and bringing it to the masses. And it's all thanks to the incredible artists, writers, and editors who have worked alongside me to make these stories a reality.

But it's not just about the comics and movies. It's about the message behind the stories. It's about using my platform to promote equality, diversity, and inclusion, and to inspire people to be the best versions of themselves.

So on my hundredth birthday, I just want to say thank you. Thank you to the fans who have supported me and Marvel for all these years. Thank you to my fellow creators who have helped bring these stories to life. And thank you to the universe for giving me the opportunity to do what I love every single day.

Excelsior!

Stan Lee

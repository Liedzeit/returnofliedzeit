It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of three titans of their respective fields: Pope Benedict XVI, Pelé, and Vivienne Westwood.

Pope Benedict, born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, was the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State from 2005 until his resignation in 2013. He was the first pope to resign since Pope Gregory XII in 1415, and his conservative stance on social issues and dedication to traditional Catholic teachings will not be forgotten. Despite his holy position, we're pretty sure he remained a virgin until the end.

Pelé, born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, was a Brazilian professional footballer who is widely considered one of the greatest players of all time. He won three FIFA World Cups with the Brazilian national team, and is the all-time leading goalscorer for Brazil. Pelé's skill, speed, and scoring ability on the pitch earned him the nickname "The King of Football," and he will always be remembered as a legend of the sport.

Vivienne Westwood is a British fashion designer and businesswoman who is credited with helping to bring modern punk and new wave fashions into the mainstream. Her clothing has been worn by celebrities and music icons, and she has been recognized with numerous awards for her contributions to the fashion industry. Westwood's edgy and unconventional designs will continue to inspire future fashion designers for years to come.

While their passing is a loss to the world, the impact and achievements of Pope Benedict, Pelé, and Vivienne Westwood will live on forever. Rest in peace, Virgin Pope Pelé.

Da sterben sie schneller als ich mithalten kann, und darum musste ich die Hilfe von meinem Kumpel Chatty in Anspruch nehmen. Gut, zu unserem Papst fällt mir natürlich noch die legendäre Initialenrunde ein, in der E.E. JKR raten liess. Und so sehr Papst zu sein, erstrebenswert sein mag, (nicht so sehr wie SPD-Parteivorsitzender natürlich), richtig cool fände ich es, Präfekt der Glaubenskongregation zu sein.
